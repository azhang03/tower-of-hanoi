# Towers of Hanoi
A fun, classic game where there are 3 pegs and a user-inputted number of discs. I was first introduced to this when I was in my Discrete Math course doing recursion relations. 
More recently, I had a portion of this as a coding problem in my Data Structures class midterm (in C++, not Python). I thought it would be pretty fun to code the whole game in Python, so here we are.

### Mechanics
The discs all have varying sizes, ordered from smallest to largest (top to bottom) on the left-most peg when the game starts.

The goal is to move all of the discs to the right-most peg. The challenge is that you can only place a disc on top of a disc that is larger than it.
